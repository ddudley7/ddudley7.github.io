    "### Background \n",
    "I am an active member of Reddit. I often seek to reddit for recommendations in travel, food, breweries, music, etc. And as a Indianapolis Colts Fan, one of my guilty pleasures is frequenting the Colts Subreddit during the season and talk about the team with other fans. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few months ago I was scrolling through Twitter and saw an article where somebody computed the most typed curse word in every NFL teams subreddit. While knowing this information does not bring any business or personal value, it was funny at the time and gave me an idea. I wanted to look into which Colts players are talked about the most in the Colts subreddit. Furthermore, I wanted to see if there was a correlation between their play on the field and the amount they are mentioned on the subreddit. Lastly, if there was such a correlation, I wanted to build a model to predict the occurance a player will be mentioned based on their performance in a game. **For this project, I worked with only the Defensive players on the Colts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "1. Build datasets that consists of the defensive statistics of each player on the defense. This was done for Weeks 1-15 of the 2019 Regular season. The statistics for each game/player were pulled from pff.com (Pro Football Focus). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Used the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) to connect to the Colts subreddit and extract the user comments from each games **Game Day Thread and Post Game Day Thread**. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compute the count of how many times a player was talked about in the Game day and Post Game Day threads combined. Then merge those counts with the defensive statistics dataset per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once Week 1-15 data was merged into one dataframe, I analyzed the correlation between the defensive statistics features and the reddit counts. I ran sensitivites on which features were  to be used in the model to reduce the mean root squared error and to improve the r-squared measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After settling on a regression model, I was able to predict reddit counts per individual players based on statistical performance in a game also with running sensativities, etc, using the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Lagniappe - performed data analysis on position groups\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "1. The defensive statistics were pulled from pff.com (Pro Football Focus). The defensive statistics I used for each player were as follows: Total Snaps, Total Pressures, Sacks, Hurries, Total Tackles, Missed Tackles, Stops, Forced Fumbles, Interceptions, Pass Breakups, Penalties, yards per reception, and receptions. I wanted to make sure to get a mixture of positive statistics (i.e. sacks, interceptions) and negative statistics (i.e. Missed_Tackles, Penalties).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The user comments extracted from the Game Thread and Post Game threads for each game from the Colts Subreddit. I chose those threads because they contain the most comments and the comments are very focused on how players are playing in that game. In other words, I know that if a player is being talked about in one of those threads, it is likely due to something they did on the field in the game - whether good or bad.\n",
